## URL Redirects - root directory of the public doc site (non-versioned)
# [ci-redirect] [InfraInfo] See gulpfile.js in the doc-site repo.
# Some redirects are handled via Hugo aliases in the Markdown front matter,
# which results in a directory for the redirected page that contains an index
# file with the redirection code.
# [ci-redirect-anchors] (sharonl) It's not possible to redirect specific anchor
# tags (#). Such tags are not considered part of the redirected URL and are
# simply attached to the destination redirection URL as-is; (it might be
# possible to eliminate the appending of the anchor from the redirected URL to
# the destination URL with rewrite rules, but this would apply to all redirects
# and in some cases we want to keep the original anchor, and on the flip side
# there's no real harm with keeping an invalid anchor in the destination URL).

# [InfraInfo] (sharonl) The source URL starts with "/docs" => RedirectMatch
# with a starts-with rule should begin with "^/docs".

#///////////////////////////////////////
## Obsolete Multi-Versioned Site URLs

# Redirect old versioned sections URLs (<section>/<version>/ where <version> is
# "vX.Y" or "latest-release") to <version>/<section>
# <section>/vX.Y/* > latest-release/)
RedirectMatch 301 ^/(docs)/(concepts|intro|reference|release-notes|specs|tutorials)/(v[0-9]\.[0-9]|latest-release)(|/.*)$ https://www.iguazio.com/$1/$3/$2$4

# Redirect old non-versioned section pages (such as release-notes/*) and all
# section root-directory URLs (<section>/ - after the <section>/<version>/
# redirect) to latest-release/<section>/*
RedirectMatch 301 ^/(docs)/(concepts|intro|reference|release-notes|specs|tutorials)(|/.*)$ https://www.iguazio.com/$1/latest-release/$2$3

#///////////////////////////////////////
## Latest-Release Version-Number URLs
#(/v<X.Y/X.Y.Z (latest release)>/* > /latest-release/*)
# [TODO-NEW-VER] Update the hardcoded version number in the source URL.
RedirectMatch 301 ^/(docs)/v3.5(\.[0-9]|)(|/.*)$ https://www.iguazio.com/$1/latest-release$3

## Next-Release Version-Number URLs
#(/v<X.Y/X.Y.Z (next minor release)>/* > /latest-release/*)
# [InfraInfo] (sharonl) (12.1.21) It was decided that in order to allow linking
# to the relevant versioned product documentation from external sources - such
# as the product dashboard (UI) and v3io/tutorials - as part of the development
# for the next product release, before we've published related documentation,
# we'll also redirect docs/vX.Y URLs for the next minor release to the latest
# docs.
# [TODO-NEW-VER] Update the hardcoded version number in the source URL.
RedirectMatch 301 ^/(docs)/v3.6(\.[0-9]|)(|/.*)$ https://www.iguazio.com/$1/latest-release$3

#///////////////////////////////////////
## Removed Old-Release Doc Sites (No Longer Published)
# [ci-docs-archive-redirects] The v1.9-v2.2 docs-archive site pages are first
# redirected to matching docs/* pages from sites/igz/.htaccess. Pages that are
# no longer found in latest-release are redirected later in this file.
RedirectMatch 301 ^/(docs)/v(2.5|2.3|2.2|2.1|2.0|1.9)(|.[0-9])(|/.*)$ https://www.iguazio.com/$1/latest-release$4

## External Doc-Site URL Errors
# [IntInfo] (sharonl) Redirect rules to handle errors in external doc-site
# links.

# ecosystem/app-services/ > intro/ecosystem/app-services/
# [IntInfo] (sharonl) (17.3.21) I found that the v3.0.0 and v3.0.1 dashboard
# (UI) Help Center | "Application Services" tile has an error in the URL -
# missing intro/ - which is probably also true in earlier releases.
# [SITE-RESTRUCT] In v3.0.0, this URL moved to services/app-services/. This is
# handled by a redirect rule later in this file. I've now also updated the UI
# URL, for future releases (after v3.0.1) to refer to to services/app-services/.
# (Note: I only redirected latest-release/, because until v3.0, the UI doc-site
# links were always to the latest-release doc site; in v3.0.0 we moved to
# versioned URLs to match the platform version.)
